# 7-PRICE test task solution

**Demo link: [DEMO](https://7-price.vercel.app/)**

The project is implemented on the basis of **Angular**. <br/>
Linked libraries: **DevExtreme, Bootstrap**.

- Information about users is created in the form of a **DevExtreme** table, with the ability to sorting and searching.
- I get user data using the following **API**: https://randomuser.me
- To customize the appearance of the application I used DevExtreme Application Template.
- I have also added user numbering for convenience and clarity.
- To switch filters, I connected a set of **Bootstrap** checkboxes. Selected options are also stored in **LocalStorage**.
